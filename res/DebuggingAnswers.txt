Put the answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1: "finish" - 'C', "numDisks" - 5, "start" - 'A', "temp" - 'B', "totalMoves" - 28672



Q2: The file was defined in src>Demos>towersOfHanoiGUI. The function name is makeTheMagicHappen



Q3: totalMoves holds value of 31



Q4: 15



Q5:two characters



Q6:line 41: chosen += ch instead of chosen + ch



Q7:Essentially, ch would hold the first character in a word and continue into a recursive step.
    This is fine when we're going down one possible permutation, such as return "hi" from an
    original input of "hi". However, when the for-loop continues from "h" to "i" as the start of
    another possible permutation, "chosen" is still storing that original "h", so instead of
    outputting "ih" as the last possible permutation, it can't get rid of that "h" and returns
    "hih" as a result.
